# Simple-Nutrition-Calculator
Calculates calories, fats, carbs and protein value of your meal.  

Download code and run in any python interpreter. When a window pops-up, select food from list and enter amount in the blank space in grams (or milliliters if liquid). Then click "Add". Repeat process with all foods you had -> at the end you should have all nutritional values calculated, added and displayed.  Have fun :)

btw. I'm still improving this. Anticipate a newer version.
