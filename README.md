# Simple-Nutrition-Calculator
I was too lazy to calculate all the nutrition values of my food manually, so I made this.  Download code and run in any python interpreter. When a window pops-up, select food from list and enter amount in the blank space in grams (or milliliters if liquid). Then click "Add". Repeat process will all foods you had -> at the end you should have all nutritional values calculated, added and displayed.  Have fun :)
